#sudo dnf module list nvidia*
#sudo dnf module remove nvidia-driver:open-dkms

- I downloaded an official nvidia driver
- started Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-545.29.06.run
- installer crated:
/usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia-installer-disable-nouveau.conf,
        /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-installer-disable-nouveau.conf

        - rebuilt internfs

        /var/log/nvidia-installer.log
        - I reboot and try again
        - Module has compiled
- I need to shign my module. I log in into rroot to see mok keys (mokutil --list-enroled)
        - I used /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub
        - I used /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub as public key
        - I asked for 32-bit compatible
        - I added to dkms
        - I rebuilt interfs
        - I refused to update x configuration
        /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README.txt
        installation complete

        - I have a problem with my external monitor.
        - I found this: https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland/Nvidia
        - I have to say that it worked. I rebooted and added `nvidia_drm.modeset=1` in kernel cmdline parameters and it started to work.
        I need to configure grub to add this now.
        - My edit to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX - I added nvidia_drm.modeset=1
        - Now I need to use grub2-mkconfig somehow. The question is how to do this correctly...
        ```console
        root@fedora:/etc# ll |grep grub
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       22 Jan 15 01:00 grub2.cfg -> ../boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       22 Jan 15 01:00 grub2-efi.cfg -> ../boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        ```

        SO `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`

        - I'm going to disable intel gpu to check if this helps with wayland glx driver:

        sudo cat > /etc/modprobe.d/blocklist-intelgpu.conf <<EOF
        blacklist i915
        EOF

dzisiaj, driver przestal działać na najnowszym kernelu (6.8.rc).
Po research znalazłem, że tne bug był zgłoszony już w styczniu.
- pobrałem następujący plik: ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-545.29.06.run
- I found out I ran the old file xD however I need to finish installation first and then run another file

----------------------update 2024.04.15 --------------------

Now I'm on 550.67. I'm going to switch to an official fedora rpmfusion-nonfree nvidia
release to get rid of strange issues. ref link: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA#About_this_Howto
continue in a few minutes

- I've removed /usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia-installer-disable-nouveau.conf, and /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-installer-disable-nouveau.conf

=== Mon Apr 15 03:03:13 PM CEST 2024 ===
I'm starting the process.
- running sudo nvidia-uninstall
- done
- rebooting
- it rebooted successfully but I don't know what driver does it use. I suppose nouveau (lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)")
- it says driver in use nvidia xD
- running sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # rhel/centos users can use kmod-nvidia instead
- I ran int a problem with nvidia-driver module. I disabled it and trying to run above cmd again
- ok now dnf wants to install correct package (this from rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia)
- installed, checking with modinfo -F version nvidia
- it says ERROR, the website suggest to wait ~5 minutes so waiting... (13:17)
- ok now it says 550.67 rebooting
- it booted up, Now executing sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
- everything seems to work, nvidia-smi returns right-llooking output.
- now trying suspend
- while scrolling by special notes section I noticed "power" section which I had problems with, executing commands now:
- sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power
- sudo systemctl enable nvidia-{suspend,resume,hibernate}
- now trying reboot and suspend

context:
oon the forum thread https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/font-issue-on-fedora-gnome-wayland-550-67-after-suspend/288975/7
they say to set additional kernel module's parameters.
I'm going to try this out as I still have problems with suspend

- adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf
- I've called  sudo dracut --force --kver 6.8.5-201.fc39.x86_64 
- Turned out I had to add mock key again (see attached forum thread) and now it works even without modprobe.d
  Further updates after new kernel release
